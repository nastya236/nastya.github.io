I am currently an intern at [Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com) in California, led by [Samy Bengio](https://bengio.abracadoudou.com). My work, under the guidance of [Ronan Collobert](https://ronan.collobert.com), focuses on the efficient training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs).

I recently completed my Master's in Data Science at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I served as a research assistant at the [Adaptive Motor Control Lab](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org). My projects involved self-supervised pre-training on neural and behavioral data, collaborating with [Steffen Schneider](https://stes.io).

Previously, I was a Quantitative Research Intern at [WorldQuant](https://www.worldquant.com), where I specialized in fine-tuning LLMs using proprietary financial data.

I earned my BSc in Applied Mathematics and Physics from the [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/). During my undergraduate studies, I was an AI Researcher at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://mil-team.com), focusing on deploying AI models on wearable devices like phones, fitness watches, and trackers.

My areas of interest include self-supervised learning, object-centric learning, and efficient large-scale training and inference. I am also passionate about AI4Science, encompassing applications in protein folding, neuroscience, and physics.

<!-- I am actively seeking PhD positions in both the US and Europe. -->
