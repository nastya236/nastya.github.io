I am an upcoming Ph.D. student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu), under the guidance of [Prof. Mackenzie Mathis](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/mackenziemathis) (EPFL). I am excited to begin my Ph.D. journey in February 2024.

Currently, I am completing my Master's in Data Science at Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. Additionally, I serve as a research assistant at the [Adaptive Motor Control Lab]((http://www.mackenziemathislab.org), where I am involved in two projects. One focuses on extensions for [CEBRA](https://cebra.ai), led by [Steffen Schneider](https://stes.io), and the other involves improving the generalization ability of pose estimation models in [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut), collaborating with [Shaokai Ye](https://yeshaokai.github.io).

I pursued my BSc degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/).
During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://mil-team.com) as AI Researcher.
As a member of the Computer Vision and Signal Processing team, I conducted research and helped big technical companies to build and deploy AI models on wearable devices.

My research focuses on studying adaptation and generalization in minds and machines, utilizing mathematics, AI, and neuroscience. Specifically, I am passionate about learning data-driven priors and relationships from neural and behavioral data through AI for learning representations. My interests lie particularly in self-supervised learning, disentangled representation learning, generative models, and Bayesian inference.
