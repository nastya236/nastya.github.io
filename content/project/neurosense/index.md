title: "Neuro Sense: hardware-constrained human activity recognition, activity embeddings construction and heart rate estimation"

summary: "Learning activity representation and estimating heart rate using PPG and IMU data from the smartwatch. Activity encoding was trained with self-supervised contrastive learning. Our heart rate estimation model archives mean absolute error 5 bpm and mean absolute percentage error only 4%. Because of the small number of params (5M MAC operations only) tiny AI chip with implemented model consumes only 0.1 mW."
